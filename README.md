# DOCKER CRASH COURSE

Docker is a software framework for building, running, and managing containers on servers and the cloud.

## 🤔 Why Docker?

- Virtual machines virtualize hardware which seems to be slow and bulky
- Docker is faster since it only virtualizes operating system
- By using isolated containers, if it works here it will work anywhere
